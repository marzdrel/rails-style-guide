## Time Tracking in Toggl

Always log everything you do related to the task. Let it be writing code,
reading the docs, trying to setup application locally or communicating with us
on Slack/Trello/email/etc.

Always try log the time immediately when doing actual task instead of filling
the entries later on.

Set the minimum entry length to 15 minutes and maximum to 60 minutes. If
you have to complete bunch of minor, trivial things, do not log every item
separately. Group them together instead. If you have big chunks of work, which
exceed 60 minutes, split the entries into smaller tasks.

Try to use generic, descriptive sentences for entry times. Do use very generic
names ("Implement feature X"). Describe each step instead: "Prepare the
local environment to boot app for development", etc.

Use imperative terms to descriptions, just like with the commit messages.
