Style Guides
============

Guides for programming in good, consistent style

Git commits
-------------------

- Commit small changes often instead of doing big commits every now
  and then
- Do not mix different issues in single commit
- If you spot any minor style issues while working on a feature commit
  them separately
- Always review changes before commiting to avoid accidental mistakes,
  and/or to avoid random files beeing added to the repository
- Do not rush your commits, review file changes and commit messages
  carefully before submitting

Git commit messages
-------------------

    Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary

    More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72
    characters.

    - If there is a need to explain the changes further use bullet
      points with dashes
    - Wrap the points at 72 characters too
    - Separate paragraphs with new line
    - Do not use dots in the title or bullet points
    - Write your commit message in the imperative (Fix bug, not Fixed
      bug, Fixes the bug)
    - Valid title should nicely end this sentence: "If submitted this
      commit will: Fix bug"
